# Currency converter

This is a desktop app developed with Visual Basic for Applications. The purpose of the project was to create a currency converter that works with real-time data fetched from the following website (currency API): https://www.xe.com/currencytables/?from=USD&date=2021-07-14

The app lets the user track the currency exchange behaviour and compare the converted values with a log of estimations and a graphical analysis.
The user form is executed in runtime in Excel when the user clicks an action button in the main worksheet.
